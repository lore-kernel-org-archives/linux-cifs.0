.

Yes - good point.  It is very easy to do on cifs.  I mainly use that to sim=
ulate
multiple clients for testing servers (so each mount to the same server
whether or not the share matched, looks like a different client, coming
from a different socket and thus with different session ids and tree
ids as well).

It is very useful when trying to simulate multiple clients running to the s=
ame
server while using only one client machine (or VM).

The nfs man page apparently discourages its use:

"As of kernel 2.6.18, the behavior specified by nosharecache is legacy
caching behavior. This is  considered  a  data risk"
