True, but Setattr permission has already been overloaded to allow several
different types of modifications, and it makes *much* more sense than Search
permission which should not allow any modifications.  And in practice I expect
people care more about whether modifications are permitted or not, than the
details of the finer-grained permissions.

Sort of, but actually keyctl_set_timeout() can be called at any time, and the
timeout can be set to as little as 1 second.  So I don't see how keyctl_revoke()
is that much different, fundamentally.

And who would have permission to change that flag?  It seems to be the same
problem again.

What would the behavior be if ->allow_invalidation() was not supplied?  In other
words, would the purpose of this be to lock down invalidation of dns_resolver
keys, or to restrict invalidation to *only* dns_resolver keys?

Granted by who, and how?  And do you mean keyctl_clear(), or
keyctl_invalidate()?
