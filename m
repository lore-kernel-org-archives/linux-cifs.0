Queued where?

I put it right after the network address fields affected by it.  I can
stick it between:

        char *hostname; /* hostname portion of UNC string */
        struct socket *ssocket;

So that two consecutive pointers become three consecutive pointers.  But
again, I haven't seen what you did to the structure yet...

It's a compile time constant optimized away by the compiler, and cleanly
taking out the entire dependent clause with it when it's false (because
&& only evaluates the right side when the left side is true, meaning the
if can never trigger, thus dead code elimination).

How is that ugly?  It does exactly what it says.  I'm not sure what the
criteria are here.  (Was it better when it looked like a function rather
than a constant?  I'd use the CONFIG_NET_NS symbol directly if it was 0
or 1 rather than undefined or 1, but it isn't.  It's designed for use
with #ifdefs only, not from C code.)

I tried returning a constant from a static inline, it doesn't propogate
the constant far enough to do compile time dead code elimination based
on the return value under gcc 4.4.3.

As for a macro, the constant already is a macro.  So adding more #ifdefs
to the headers to make the code in the function look like it's doing
something other than it actually is somehow improves matters?  (I'm not
understanding the aesthetic criteria here at all.)

I think I'll just ignore the bloat.  Make allnoconfig is already 800k
compressed, what's a few more bytes...

Hmmm...  Yup, failure case when CONFIG_NET_NS enabled will dereference
the null pointer.  I need to move the initialization up a few lines.
Thanks.
