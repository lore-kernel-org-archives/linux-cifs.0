There are two such container_of calls for POSIX ACLs in fs/jffs2/acl.c
[which could be replaced by get_acl()], two in fs/posix_acl.c for
POSIX ACLs, and two in fs/richacl.c for RichACLs. That's it.

I've already made such abstractions where it made sense; if you can
find more, I don't see why we shouldn't add them.

Thanks,
