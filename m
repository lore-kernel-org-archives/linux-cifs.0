This patch is great for our work on EXT4 encryption. Currently, if User
A wishes to decrypt a file and have it shared with User B, the
encryption keys must be in a keyring searchable by both users. However,
this also means that User B can just invalidate this shared keyring,
causing User A to lose access to their files.

Fixing this security issue will let us have a global keyring containing
all the EXT4 encryption keys (with type logon).
