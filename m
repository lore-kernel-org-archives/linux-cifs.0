As a "mere" end-user of SAMBA, +1 from me also...  It's my understanding
that this patch set would help eliminate the need for hacks like
vfs_acl_xattr that store ACLs in extended attributes that only SAMBA
understands.  If the file system itself can respect the ACLs that seems
like a lot cleaner solution.
