I fully understand your point. This kind of acl is one of the the
first things people will try, and nobody is going to accept when
access is denied in this case though.

Things are made worse by the fact that Windows has the concept of
owner@ or group@ entries for inheritable permissions but not for
effective ones; it will always produce and expect "bfields:rwx::allow"
type entries instead of "owner@:rwx::allow" type entries. I'm not sure
if Samba could bridge that gap.

The fact that we cannot handle entries for groups the owner is in in a
similar way is not a big deal; it's not surprising that changing the
group file mode permission bits affects group entries.

Thanks,
Andreas
