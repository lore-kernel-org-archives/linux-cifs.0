In POSIX ACLs, only the entry that best matches the process determines
the access permissions. For the file owner, this would always be the
"user::" entry, and such an entry always exists.

In richacls, permissions from multiple entries do accumulate; the
permission check algorithm does not pick a "best match". When bfields
owns a file and a "bfields:rwx::allow" entry exists, denying rwx
access to bfields would be very surprising. It makes more sense to put
user entries that match the current owner into the owner class, and
apply the owner mask instead of the group mask. This was working in an
earlier version but apparently broke at some point.

So the result that richacl_apply_masks computes here is correct, and
the permission check algorithm needs a little fix.

Thanks,
Andreas
