I'm not sure I agree.  The problem is that you then have to grant someone
Setattr permission for them to be able to do this, which then opens up a whole
host of other things they can also do.

Note that setting the expiry time is not really equivalent to revokation in
this regard as setting the expiry time is something you do when setting up a
key, whereas revokation is something you do later to kill a key off.

That's not really a viable solution as things stand.  You can't turn Write
permission on on a key whose type doesn't have an ->update() method (though
this could be changed) and it also opens up a key to being modified.

How about another solution:

 (1) I add a flag to a key to say that it can be invalidated and a keyctl to
     change that flag.

 (2) I add a new key type op called ->allow_invalidation() that allows key
     types to govern separately who is allowed to invalidate keys of that
     type.

     So, for instance, DNS record invalidation would require CAP_NET_ADMIN.

 (3) Allow keyrings to be cleared by users who don't have Write permission but
     do have other permission, such as CAP_NET_ADMIN.  This would need to be
     granted on a per-keyring basis.
